# Toadstool Changelog

###0.1.0
* Setting up normal versioning
* Overhaul of color palette view
* Re-Implemented color defaults so that preset semantic colors update when `_confic.scss` colors are updated
	* This required the creation of `/sass/color/_color_defaults.scss` which is a duplication of defaults found in Stipe
	* Defaults are needed in stipe for the gem to process default colors
	* Defaults are needed in Toadstool in order to process the default colors using local value
* Updates to `/toadstool/sass/color/_extends.scss`
	* Added new `name_color_loop` mixin
	* Dynamically looping through list of OOCSS names to create color block placeholder classes
* Added `contenteditable` support for code examples
	* Users can now edit the code example in the view and then copy for use in other context of the application 
	* UI Fail: You can't see the caret in the text. [Possible solution](http://jsbin.com/ehuki3/3/edit)
* Updated button support
	* Added new color swatch to colors view
	* Deprecated `$primary_button_border_color` from the view
* Deleted legacy button libraries, they all sucked anyway
* Updated commonly named color values with `' '` to keep Sass from converting names to hex values
* Added Growl support
